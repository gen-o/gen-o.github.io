<p>
GENO is a generic model for describing genetic entities and their relationships. It is applicable in the fields of genetic criticism, scholarly editing, authorial philology and in general for the study of authorial manuscripts and writing processes.</p>

<h3>Background, terminology, competency questions and corresponding sparql queries</h3>

<p>Genetic criticism and authorial philology are fields of study dealing with the genesis of literary, and more in general textual, works. A genetic witness is a document bearing witness to the genesis of a work, such as a manuscript, a typescript, a proof, a printed copy, a digital file, etc. While the single genetic witnesses can be formally modelled using the standards developed by the Text Encoding Initiative, their status as genetic entities and the relationship between them has not received the same attention, thus no computational analysis has been possible so far. GENO aims at filling this gap, by providing a model for describing the networks of genetic witnesses.</p>

<p>Examples of genetic networks from the Roud project:
	<ul>
		<li>The diary note "Missy11 h et demie" (CLSR GR MS 4 A/3a) is copied in a diary notebook as "Missy 11 h et 1/2 soir" (CLSR GR MS 4 A/1a). This note is reused in "Cendre", article published in the periodical *Aujourd'hui* on the 10th of July 1930. This article is partially used in the book *Air de la solitude*, published in 1945.</li>
		<li>The two articles of literary criticism about the writer Catherine Colomb, "Catherine Colomb, romancière vaudoise" and "Notre monde périssable sauvé par la poésie", published in 1956 and 1965 in the periodical *Gazette de Lausanne*, are reused in the making of the preface to the complete works of Catherine Colomb, published in 1968.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>GENO in use</h3>

<p>GENO is meant to be general enough to accommodate the needs of different projects. In practice, it should be combined with other ontologies for describing bibliographic and archival resources. GENO is quite small and simple, because it only focuses on the materials from the point of view of the genetic status and relationships.</p>


<h4>Testing GENO (current version: 1.0)</h4>

<p>GENO has been tested with two case studies: the Roud project and the *Bernard Comment, “En mer”* prototype. [Data and sparql queries](https://github.com/gen-o/geno/tree/master/current/data) are available for both case studies: you can test GENO in your preferred triplestore or via a jupyter notebook.</p>


<h4>GENO implementation in the Roud project (previous version: 0.2)</h4>

<p>GENO (versions 0.1 and 0.2) has been created as part of the project « Gustave Roud. *Œuvres complètes* », the critical edition of the complete works of the Swiss author Gustave Roud (1897-1976) (directed by D. Maggetti and C. Jaquier, University of Lausanne, 2017-2021). To know more about the project and the implementation of GENO in it, please see [Gustave Roud. Textes et archives](https://roud.unil.ch/) and [GENO previous version documentation](https://github.com/gen-o/geno/tree/master/2019-09-01).</p>
